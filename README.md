•Poor data modeling affects the over all performance of the report

•Following Good practices of data modeling is must. Refer this page to get to know the good practices [Blog](https://addendanalytics.com/blog/data-modelling-best-practices/)

•In this project, we have followed Snowfall data modeling method.

### Dashboard designing
Based on the mock ups received as requirement, the team will start designing the visuals and create measure as and when required
